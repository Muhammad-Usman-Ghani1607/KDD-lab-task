Code Overview
This is the brief code report explaining the code main points:
Libraries Imported:
- datasets: Used to load the PubMed Summarization dataset.
- re: Provides functions for working with regular expressions.
- transformers: Imports `T5Tokenizer` and `T5ForConditionalGeneration` for model training.
- ipywidgets: Used for creating interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks.
- IPython.display: Allows displaying HTML content within the notebook.
- Output, Button: Specific widgets imported from `ipywidgets` for file upload and button functionality.

Dataset Loading and Preparation:
- PubMed Summarization Dataset: Loaded using `load_dataset` from the `datasets` library. The dataset is accessed, and specifically the `train` split is used for training purposes.

Text Preprocessing:
- Preprocessing Function: `preprocess_text` function is defined to remove special characters and unnecessary spaces from text data using regular expressions (`re`).

Model and Tokenizer Setup:
- T5 Model and Tokenizer: `T5Tokenizer` and `T5ForConditionalGeneration` are initialized from the `transformers` library, using the pre-trained `t5-small` model.

Summarization Function:
- generate_summary: Uses the T5 model to generate a summary of the input text. It encodes the input text using the tokenizer, generates the summary using the model, and decodes it back into readable text.

File Upload and Summarization Handling:
- on_upload Function: Handles the file upload event triggered by the user. It checks if a file has been uploaded, reads its content, preprocesses the text, generates a summary using the `generate_summary` function, and displays both the original article and its summarized version using HTML formatting.

Widgets Creation and Display:
- FileUpload Widget: `upload_widget` is created to allow users to upload `.txt` files.
- Button Widget: `upload_button` is a button widget labeled 'Upload and Summarize' that triggers the `on_upload` function when clicked.
- Output Widget: `output` is an output widget that displays the original article and its summarized version.

Display Widgets:
- VBox Layout: Uses `widgets.VBox` to vertically stack the `upload_widget` and `upload_button`.
- Display Output: `output` widget is displayed to show the results of file upload and summarization.

Execution Flow:
1. Initialization: Libraries are imported, dataset is loaded, and necessary functions (`preprocess_text`, `generate_summary`, `on_upload`) are defined.
2. Widget Setup: `upload_widget` for file upload, `upload_button` for triggering upload action, and `output` for displaying results are created.
3. Interaction: Users upload a `.txt` file using `upload_widget`, click 'Upload and Summarize' on `upload_button`, triggering the `on_upload` function.
4. Result Display: Original article and summarized version are displayed in `output` using HTML formatting.

Conclusion:
The provided code snippet creates an interactive environment in a Jupyter notebook where users can upload PubMed articles in `.txt` format, preprocess the text, generate summaries using a pre-trained T5 model, and view both the original and summarized versions of the article. It effectively integrates data preprocessing, model usage, and interactive widget handling for a streamlined user experience.
